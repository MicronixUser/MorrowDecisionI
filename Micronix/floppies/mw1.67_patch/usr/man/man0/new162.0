The scheduling algorithm for keyboard respone has been modified to

/upm4.2
.br
This new version of upm is experimental.  It provides the option of
a -p flag to suppress polling.  Some applications software will
not run with this flag.  When the use of this flag does not block
the application software, its use should enhance response time
for other users on the system.  Other flags are also provided.  See
the flags section of the upm documentation.
