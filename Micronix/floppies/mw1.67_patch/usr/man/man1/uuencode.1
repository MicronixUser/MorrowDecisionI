SYNTAX

uudecode [filename]

DESCRIPTION
.br
Uuencode and uudecode provide the means to 
convert any arbitrary file into a text file
and back again.
Our version is compatible with standard unix
uuencode and uudecode.
These programs are intended for use
with cu(1).
An algorithm is used which results in an approximate
35% expansion in the file.
Each triple of bytes in the file has its
3 sets of 8 bits converted to 4 sets of 6 bits,
thus expanding 3 bytes to 4.
